        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Another super simple and yet very tasty dish is the
            quesadilla. This dish is also fairly versatile. You
            could make it with just cheese and veggies, or any type
            of meat you feel like adding!
        </p>
        <p>In this recipe I will be covering a variation that involves
            using chicken. If that isnt your style you could always leave
            out the chicken and just make a cheese variation!
        </p>

                plate.
            </li>
            <li>Heat remaining tablespoon vegetable oil over medium-high
                heat. Season chicken with spices, salt, and pepper, and

                through, 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

            <li>Add 1 flour tortilla to skillet and top half of the
                tortilla with a heavy sprinkling of both cheeses,
                coocked chicken mixture, pepper-onion mixture, a few
                slices of avocado, and green onions. Fold the other
                half of the tortilla over and cook, flipping once,
                until golden, 3 minutes per side. Repeat to make
                4 quesadillas.
