        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 1/3 cups of milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>butter, for the pan</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, pulse the eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla,
                salt, and flour for 7 - 10 seconds, or until the
                batter is smooth. Pour into a bowl. (The batter
                can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 3 days.
                If the batter thickens too much, add additional milk
                before cooking to thin it to the consistency of
                heavy cream.)
            </li>
            <li>Heat an 8 or 10 inch non-stick skillet ow well seasoned
                crepe pan over medium heat until hot. Using one end of
                a stick of butter, coat the bottom of the pan with a 
                thin layer of melted butter.
            </li>
            <li>Pour 1/3 cup of batter into the center of the pan.
                Immediately pick up the pan and tilt and swirl it
                to spread the batter evenlu over the bottom. Cook
                for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the crepe is golden
                on the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>Use a rubber spatula to loosen the edge of the
                crepe all around. Hold the edge with your fingertips
                and gently, but quickly, flip the crepe to the other
                side (or use a spatula if that feels more comfortable).
            </li>
            <li>Cook for another 30 seconds, or until the crepe
                is golden on the bottom. Slife the finished crepe
                onto a plate.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat until all the batter is used, stacking the
                crepes on top of each other on the plate
            </li>
            <li>Place one crepe on a plate and fill it with your
                filling of choice. Either roll the crepe or fold it
                into quarters and top with additional toppings if
                desired. Serve warm.
            </li>
        </ol>
