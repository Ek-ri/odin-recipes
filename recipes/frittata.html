                non-stick pan, add enough olive oil to cover the bottom
                of the pan. Add the onion, season to taste with salt,
                saute for two minutes or until softened, then add the
                pepper; continue to saute for three more minutes or
                until it gets some color.
            </li>
            <li>In a bowl, beat the eggs until homogenous, whisk the
                eggs to incorporate air. Add the salt, heavy cream,
                whole milk, and add it to the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Add the cheddar, feta cheese, stir the mixture until
                the eggs begin to pull from the pan, and place it in
                the oven (convection if possible) for 15 - 18
                minutes or until puffed and cooked
            </li>
