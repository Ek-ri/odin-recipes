# odin-recipes
My first project in The Odin Project course

The project I've been assigned is to create a basic recipe website.
At this current moment I will be using only HTML, no CSS or JavaScript
at the current time.

This project will demonstrate skills I have learned so far in The Odin
Project. These skills will include: git workflow, HTML, making
meaningful commit messages, and general knowledge of commands
in the Linux terminal.
